# Spark Graphics
This repository contains the motherload of Spark SC graphics, used to share designs internally among the organization.

## Git Basics
“Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. ” ([Git](https://git-scm.com/)). This just means that developers (or designers in our case) can pass around files easily and manage different versions of the files, all under one online location. We use Github to keep our files organized and available for everyone within Spark SC.

### Command Line Git
If you are a computer scientist, you generally want to follow this method of contributing to Github.
1. **Set Up Git**: Do you know how to use the terminal?  If so, then set up git if you haven’t already by following this:
[Git - First-Time Git Setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)
2. **Clone this Repository**: Copy the SSH key into your terminal and run `git clone [ssh-key]`. This should create a folder called “graphics” in your file system. Enter that folder on your terminal.
3. **Contribute your files**: Add your files that you want to share to this folder in the respective committee folder (or create your own folder for your design project). Run `git add --all` and `git commit -m "Your commit message here"`  and then `git push` to send your files off to Github for everyone else to see!

### Github.com
If you have little knowledge on coding, then follow this method to upload files.
1. **Go to this page:** [GitHub - gosparksc/graphics: Repository for graphical assets delineated by committee.](https://github.com/gosparksc/graphics)
2. **Upload a new file**: Hit the `Upload files` button at the top. Drag and drop your files into the folder you wish to contribute to.
